          <p>In just a short amount of time, our certified Dance Instructors can help you learn a few basic steps, so you will feel at ease and confident on your wedding day. Have something bigger in mind? We can choreograph the whole dance with you even include the wedding party! There are no hard & fast rules so you decide on the plan. We do recommend scheduling your lessons at least a month before the ceremony (and further in advance, for more involved routines) so give us call today for a consult. Bring along your favorite song, pictures of your venue, wedding attireâ€¦ everything you would like to share, to help us make your dream dance a reality.

        <h3>COST</h3>
        <p>We offer special introductory packages that help you create a dream Wedding Dance that is a great value. Lessons with just the two of you can range from a few simple dance steps to a fully-choreographed dance. We can include your wedding party, for a YouTube-worthy routine. And including your parents (or special friends or family members who will be standing in that traditional role) in your Wedding Dance can be a wonderful way to show your love and appreciation. It is totally up to you!
